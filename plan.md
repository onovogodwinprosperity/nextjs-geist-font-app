# Plan for Building a Fullstack NestJS Jiji.com Clone

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to create a fullstack application that mimics the functionality of jiji.com, a classified ads marketplace. The application will consist of a NestJS backend and a Next.js frontend, with features such as user authentication, product listings, image uploads, and messaging.

## Key Features
1. **User Registration and Authentication**
   - Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
   - JWT-based authentication for secure access.

2. **Product Listings**
   - Users can create, edit, and delete product listings.
   - Each listing will have images, descriptions, prices, and categories.

3. **Image Uploads**
   - Users can upload images for their product listings.
   - Use local storage or a service like Cloudinary for image management.

4. **Search and Filtering**
   - Users can search for products by keywords and filter by categories.

5. **User Profiles**
   - Users can view and edit their profiles, including their listings.

6. **Messaging System**
   - Users can send messages to each other regarding listings.

7. **Admin Panel**
   - Admins can manage users and listings.

8. **Payment Integration (Optional)**
   - Integrate a payment gateway for premium listings.

9. **Email Notifications**
   - Send email notifications for registration, messages, and listing updates.

## Step-by-Step Outline

### 1. Set Up the Project Structure
- Create a new directory for the project.
- Initialize a new NestJS application in the backend directory.
- Initialize a new Next.js application in the frontend directory.

### 2. Backend Development (NestJS)
#### 2.1. Install Dependencies
- Install necessary packages:
  ```bash
  npm install @nestjs/core @nestjs/common @nestjs/platform-express @nestjs/jwt @nestjs/passport passport passport-jwt bcrypt mongoose
  ```

#### 2.2. Create Modules
- **Auth Module**: Handle user registration and authentication.
- **Users Module**: Manage user profiles.
- **Products Module**: Manage product listings.
- **Messages Module**: Handle messaging between users.

#### 2.3. Implement Authentication
- Create JWT strategy for authentication.
- Implement user registration and login endpoints.

#### 2.4. Implement Product Management
- Create endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting product listings.
- Implement image upload functionality.

#### 2.5. Implement Messaging
- Create endpoints for sending and receiving messages.

#### 2.6. Set Up Database
- Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage.
- Create models for users, products, and messages.

### 3. Frontend Development (Next.js)
#### 3.1. Install Dependencies
- Install necessary packages:
  ```bash
  npm install axios react-hook-form
  ```

#### 3.2. Create Pages
- **Home Page**: Display product listings.
- **Login/Register Pages**: Forms for user authentication.
- **Profile Page**: User profile management.
- **Product Page**: Display individual product details.

#### 3.3. Implement Forms
- Use React Hook Form for managing forms.
- Implement validation for user inputs.

#### 3.4. Implement API Calls
- Use Axios to communicate with the NestJS backend.
- Handle authentication and data fetching.

#### 3.5. Create UI Components
- Design modern, responsive UI components using Tailwind CSS.
- Ensure accessibility and responsiveness.

### 4. Testing
- Write unit tests for backend services and controllers.
- Write integration tests for API endpoints.
- Test frontend components using React Testing Library.

### 5. Deployment
- Prepare the application for deployment.
- Use services like Heroku or Vercel for hosting.

## Error Handling and Best Practices
- Implement error handling in both backend and frontend.
- Use middleware for logging and error responses in NestJS.
- Validate user inputs on both client and server sides.

## Summary
- This plan outlines the creation of a fullstack NestJS application that mimics jiji.com.
- Key features include user authentication, product listings, messaging, and an admin panel.
- The project will be structured with a NestJS backend and a Next.js frontend.
- Testing and deployment strategies are included to ensure a robust application.

This plan provides a comprehensive approach to building the application, ensuring all necessary features and best practices are considered.
